Full Update Log: 

Yeah, so the two tables are what I was able to condense, with both output and input being connected by a primary key via rocket_id. 
Set the rocket_id to what you want in order to set it as empty, with astronaut, or with rover. 
If there are errors, bugs, or items missing, PLEASE LET ME KNOW! I'll swiftly update the database.
-
The .csv files were also uploaded in case of a simpler data structure being needed.

3/5/25 UPDATE:
+Database schema was exported and now uploaded as "rocket database.sql" 
-Other .sql or .csv files are now outdated, but if they serve useful, then use them and modify if you like. (NOW DELETED, REPLACED WITH CURRENT FILES)

3/6/25 UPDATE:
+NEW file was created to run both python scripts together. (IMPORTANT: PLEASE REVIEW PYTHON FILES)
+Database updated to correspond to the files
+Both of pre-existing backend codes were edited substantially to include proper database values and columns
